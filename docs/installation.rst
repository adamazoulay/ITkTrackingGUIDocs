Installation
============

There are three steps for the installation of the ITG:

1. Copy the source code to your computer
2. Install Python 3.6 and pip
3. Install the dependencies required for the code to run


For step 1, you can `Download and extract`_ the source code manually or you can `Clone the repo`_ from GitLab. Downloading
and extracting will allow you to quickly get up and running but will force you to repeat the process for future updates.
Cloning the repo will allow you to download future updates directly to your computer by running a single command in git.


Downloading the source code
---------------------------

Download and extract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To download an archive of the latest stable version, navigate to the GitLab page for the `ITk Tracking GUI`__
and click on the |download| button, and select the archive type you wish to download (.zip is usually fine for
most purposes).

Once you have the archive stored on your computer, extract it to the location you would like to store the program.


Clone the repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To clone the repo from gitlab, you must have git installed on your computer
