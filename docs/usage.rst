Usage
========

To run the program, open a command window inside of the ``bin`` folder.

Make sure you are running Python 3 (by ``running python --version`` on windows or ``python3 --version`` on MacOS/linux).

Finally, run the code:

.. code-block:: python

	python main.py

or

.. code-block:: python

	python3 main.py

depending on which command is used for Python 3.

You should see the program open up. You will find options for a new file, opening, and saving in the File menu.

To input configuration (such as username and institute), go to the File menu and click Configuration. Fill in all
relevant information  and click Apply, then close the window. This information will be saved in the save file.
